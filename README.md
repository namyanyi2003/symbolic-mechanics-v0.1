Whitepaper: Symbolic Mechanics v0.1 — A foundational mechanical framework for symbolic processing.

**Author:** A.N. Eidos  
**Version:** 0.1

## Overview

Symbolic Mechanics proposes that the inner world operates as a **closed, deterministic mechanical system**.  
Every subjective event — regardless of meaning or narrative — is forced through the same perpetual engine:

**Δ → S → L → R → Exit → New Δ**

This is **not** a metaphor.  
It is the **literal algorithm** governing symbolic processing, rupture, and regeneration.

The framework formalizes:

- Δ — Perceived Difference  
- S — Symbolic Object  
- The Four Seats  
- L — Load Accumulation  
- R — Rupture  
- The Three Exit Pathways  
- SCd / SCr — The Dual Processing Modules  
- The Cycle That Generates All Inner Experience

## Whitepaper Contents

### **P1 — The Mechanical Substrate**
Defines the perpetual symbolic engine and establishes the deterministic loop Δ → S → L → R → Exit → Δ.

### **P2 — Core Mechanical Units**
Formal definitions of the five irreducible units: Δ, S, Four Seats, L, R.

### **P3 — Dual Processing Modules (SCd & SCr)**
The system contains two mutually exclusive processors that compete to handle Δ.

### **P4 — The Perpetual Engine**
A full specification of the cyclic algorithm, including the three deterministic exit pathways.

### **P5 — Three Emergent Human Configurations**
Formal derivation of three structural psychological types generated by module dominance and seat bias.

### **P6 — Extensions & Forward Models**
Outlines predictive structures, simulations, and future formal developments.
