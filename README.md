# Symbolic Mechanics — v0.1  
**A Foundational Mechanical Framework for Symbolic Processing**  
**Author:** A.N. Eidos  
**Version:** 0.1  
**Year:** 2026  

---

## Overview

**Symbolic Mechanics** proposes that the inner world operates as a **closed, deterministic mechanical system**.  
Every subjective event—regardless of narrative or meaning—is processed through a single perpetual engine:

### **Δ → S → L → R → Exit → New Δ**

This is **not a metaphor**,  
but the **literal algorithm** governing symbolic processing, rupture, and regeneration.

The framework formalizes:

- **Δ** — Perceived Difference  
- **S** — Symbolic Object  
- **Four Seats** — Structural positions determining load behavior  
- **L** — Load Accumulation  
- **R** — Rupture  
- **Exit Pathways** — Violent / Delayed / Mourning  
- **SCd / SCr** — The Dual Processing Modules  
- The **Perpetual Cycle** that generates all inner experience
